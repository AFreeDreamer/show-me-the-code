working at a disability/welfare office
and I got to see the coolest thing today.
A homeless man, Charlie,
came in with a power wheelchair
that didn't work.
Its batteries would no longer charge.
As I was pushing him around the office,
first to get checked in,
then to an outlet
to get some charge in his batteries,
then back to a window to be seen... etc.
A woman noticed
and asked Charlie if his chair was dead
and how long he had it.
He's needed it for about three years now,
after he got stabbed in the back of the neck
leaving him paralyzed on the left side.
He's on disability
and doesn't have much money to replace the battery
which will now only hold a charge for about ten minutes,
so he mostly just pushes himself around with his right foot,
traveling backwards.
The Woman, Diane,
explained that her brother is also paralyzed
and they have an older chair that they're not using.
She asked Charlie if he would like it.
Charlie said yes.
Diane left and came back about an hour later.
She asked me to unload the new chair,
which I did.
Now,
I don't know much about powered wheelchairs,
but I can tell this is no basic model.
It not only drives,
it can lift up,
recline,
and do other stuff too.
Turns out it's like a $20,000 chair.
Charlie looked it over Charlie
and said it sure is nice.
But Diane tells us there's one small problem,
the new chair won't charge
because it hasn't been used in two years.
So what does Diane do?
She tells Charlie
she will take it over to the Medical Supply Store
that's just a block away
and see if they can put new batteries in it
or get it working.
So I loaded the chair back into her van,
and they all took off
to get the new chair up and running.
Let me tell you,
in 13 years of law enforcement and security work,
I've never seen anything like that.
The funny thing was
Diane actually told me I was so kindDiane
for helping Charlie get around the office.
No, ma'am it's you.
