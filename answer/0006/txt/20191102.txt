I'm a single mom.
I have three boys,
and I decided to go out for dinner tonight.
We stop at Pizza Inn
and happen to catch the tail end of the buffet.
I got the youngest one his first
so he's done first,
then he goes to play.
And were the only patrons in the establishment
so I'm watching but still eating my meal.
There was a waitress...
Catalina was her name.
She kept my son entertained while I ate,
playing with him on the play area.
This was my first time taking my sons out by myself
 
because
a.) It is expensive
and 2.) Anxiety about how they'll act/react.
This young woman made my night
 
by just that simple act of kindness...
She should be proud of herself.
Her bosses and momma should be as well!
